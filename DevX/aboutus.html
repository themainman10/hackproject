      <h3>How you save money when you use DevX</h3>
      <p>P5 DevX is able to sell mediation that is vastly cheaper than a pharmacy without sacrificing the quality of medication, for two reasons.  One we buy wholesale from drug makers directly. Second, we cut out the middlemen. Oftentimes the middle men are  directly responsible for the high fluctuations of the price for a medication, and for the high cost of a medication.
